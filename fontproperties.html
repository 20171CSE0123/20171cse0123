<p class='big'>An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument — but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc.[1]

Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples.

In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.

The concept of an "essay" has been extended to other media beyond writing. A film essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A photographic essay covers a topic with a linked series of photographs that may have accompanying text or captions. </p>
<p class='medium'>ournal writing is an informal approach to developing students’ writing skills. The assessment  is  primarily  based  on  improvement  and  completing  a  minimum  number  of  pages  (5  pages  skipping  lines)  by  the  established  deadline.  My  feedback  to  students  is  focused  on  interaction  with  what  they  have  written  as  opposed  to  correcting  syntax  or  orthography.  Since  this  is  a  dialogue  journal,  I  respect the confidential nature of what students choose to write. Be prepared for students to share anecdotes that may be sensitive in content. This is a great way to  get  to  know  your  students  on  a  more  personal  level.  I  do  not  place  a  value  judgment  on  their  ideas  or  how  compelling  their  argument  may  be.  I  am  concerned  with  improvement  from  one  journal  collection  to  the  next.  Ease  of  expression  and  sophistication  of  vocabulary  are  taken  into  account  in  the  grade  that is assigned.  One strategy, as a focus activity, is to start the class with one of the journal topics on the board or overhead when the students are entering the classroom. After a 6-7 minute writing exercise, have the students turn to the person seated next to them and converse about what they have just written. Next, solicit opinions from the class as a whole to engage the class in a discussion in Spanish. This activity focuses  on  the  synthesis  of  writing,  speaking  and  listening  while  combining  the  interpersonal and presentational modes of communication.  Students write the 5-page entries outside of class. Ideally, the class will finish the 70  pages  in  the  notebook  (skipping  lines)  by  the  date  of  the  AP  exam.  I  have  found   that   the   spiral-bound   composition   books   are   both   inexpensive   and   practical.  Different  colored  composition  books  are  used  in  rotation,  so  that  the  grading is not overwhelming. For example, I buy red, blue and green composition books,  collecting  one  color  each  week  in  a  cycle  throughout  the  semester.  Students  will  see  the  benefits  of  keeping  a  dialogue  journal  as  it  allows  them  to  get  their  ideas  down  on  paper  more  quickly  and  coherently  when  writing  more  formal  in-class  essays.  Teachers  will  likely  want  to  adapt  this  list  to  their  school  community as some topics may not be appropriate in all schools. Likewise, many of  these  would  never  appear  on  an  actual  exam  because  of  the  bias  and  controversy  that  the  topics  provoke.  Nonetheless,  these  are  topics  that  pique  students’ interest and can make for excellent discussion and essay writing.</p>
<p class='small'>This is a question we get from time to time. There are instances when you’re given an assignment, not by word count, but assigned by the number of pages. For example, “Write a paper four pages long.” If you get an assignment to write four pages, one of the first questions that will likely come to mind is, “How many words are in four pages?” If you need to figure out words per page, you can use a words per page calculator.

The truth is there is no definitive answer to this question. The number of words it will take to fill a page will depend on a number of factors including the type of font used, the font size, spacing elements, the margins used on the paper, the paragraph length, etc. For example, if the assignment says the writing should be in 10-point font, it’s going to take a greater number of words to fill a page than if the assignment requires a 12-point font.

For those who need a general rule of thumb, a typical page which has 1-inch margins and is typed in 12 point font with standard spacing elements will be approximately 500 words when typed single spaced. For assignments that require double spacing, it would take approximately 250 words to fill the page. For an assignment that requires you to write four pages, you can make the estimation that you’ll need to write approximately 2000 words for a single spaced paper, or 1000 words if the assignment is double spaced. Again, the type of font used can make the word count higher or lower, but it’s a good rule of thumb for those who are simply looking for a general estimation.

Since there can be a large variation on the number of words needed to fill a page, most papers are no longer assigned by page count. They are instead assigned by word count. That is, an assignment, essay or paper will likely be assigned as 1500 – 2000 words rather than 3 – 4 pages. This way it is much more difficult for the writer to “game the system” by using large fonts and excessive spacing to meet the writing criteria.

If you are given a writing assignment with a page number, the best thing to do is go directly to the person who made the assignment and ask for a word count. This will take away all the variations and help ensure your writing assignment meets expectations. If it’s for something informal and you simply need a general guideline, you can find it below.
